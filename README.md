# MINKWIC2023
This is a demo code repository for MINK WIC 2023 attendees to use to build their first GitHub repo.

## Overview
This file is called a README, which is why its named README.md. It is usually your first stop in any code or software, to understand the objectives and constraints of a code project, how to use it, and other helpful information. Here is a great description from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes):  
>"A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:
>  - What the project does
>  - Why the project is useful
>  - How users can get started with the project
>  - Where users can get help with your project
>  - Who maintains and contributes to the project"
Let's use that as a guideline for this README page! 

## Purpose
This is a demo code repository for MINK WIC 2023 attendees to use to build their first GitHub repo. Sometimes it is easier to grab a template for a repository and use it to build your project instead of starting from scratch. This can be your template.
